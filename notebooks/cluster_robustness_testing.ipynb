    "This script is designed to test the robustness of the clustering parameters. K-means is initiated using a random process, and therefore can give different answers based on the random initiation. Therefore it is important to test if our The user enters a data path, any data restrictions such as lat/lon bounding box, time range, k-means properties, and a number of trials to preform. The clustering is then preformed n_trials times creating k * n_trials CRs. These are then clustered with the same values of k. If the clustering parameters are robust, this should return k clusters each with n_trials members, where each member is very similar within clusters. For example, if a stratocumulus CR is created, that stratocumulus CR should look cery similar in each of the clustering trials. To examine this, this script plots the results of the second clustering step. It shows each group of k cluster centers, and a correlation matrix between each of those clusters. Ideally, there should be n_trials histograms, that look very similar with high coeficients of correlation. "
