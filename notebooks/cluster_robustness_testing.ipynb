    "## Overview\n",
    "K-means is initiated using a random process, and therefore can give different answers based on the random initiation. It is important we make sure our k-means setup is robust, and returns very similar results every time. K-means not returning thsimilar results can be indicative of a few things. It can often be a symptom of the value of k being too small, or it can mean that n_init is not high enough. The n_init variable is how many times k-means clustering is preformed for each call of the k-means function. The initiation with the best final result (most compact clusters) will be chosen as the final output. The larger n_init is the longer the computation time but the more robust the final output is. \n",

    "In previous works ([Tselioudis et al. 2013](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/26/19/jcli-d-13-00024.1.xml)) have tested for a robust k-means setup by preforming the clustering three times for the final k and checking that the correlations between the cluster centers is > 0.8.\n",
    "\n",
    "This script will preform kmeans clustering n_trials times, and test if correlations between the cluster centers is > correlation_limit, where n_trials and correlation_limit are user defined variables. Feel free to start with n_trials=3 and correlation_limit=0.8, but if computation power allows it may be worth experimenting with more rigourous requirements. "

To start off leave these variables alone, but later on feel free to experiment and change n_trials and correlation_limit. Also free to mess around with the k-means properties. Try increasing tol or decreasing n_init, try an innapropriate value of k or random initiation vs k-means++. Change plot_cr_centers or plot_rfo_graphs to true to plot the clustering results from each trial and examine how similar they are. It is also worth noting that just because a k-means setup is robust for the relatively small ISCCP dataset we're using, does not mean it will be robust for much larger datasets.\n",
